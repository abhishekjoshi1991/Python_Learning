'''memory efficient objects-
this stores the data in memory and gives objects when we run them

to get data from these, we need to type cast them to list or tuple or we can
iterate over them to get data

range(), map, filter , reduce, lambda etc
'''

print(range(0,10)) #this gives object at some memory location
print(list(range(0,10))) #type casted to list and now giving data
